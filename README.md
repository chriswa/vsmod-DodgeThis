# vsmod-DodgeThis

Are you finding it a little too easy to kite drifters by dancing out of their attack range as soon as they start swinging their big, slow arms?

This mod makes melee combat more difficult by randomizing attack animation timing (between 1-4 times faster,) while also providing a range bonus after starting an attack.

## Work In Progress

This mod needs testing in the field! And feedback, please!
